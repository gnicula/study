SETUP:
	I used ANTLR4 antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar downloaded from https://www.antlr.org/download.html

	I used Java version Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 16.0.1+9-24)

GRAMMAR:
	I used grammar url.g4 downloaded from https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/url/url.g4

TESTS:
	I used grun to test different inputs, see input1_graph.jpg and input2_graph.jpg

PROGRAM OUTPUT: 
	The program assumes input1.txt and input2.txt are in the same folder as the 'Recognizer.java' and it will print 'Passed' or 'Failed' for each of them, to the console.
