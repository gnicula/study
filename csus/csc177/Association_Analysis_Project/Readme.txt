Association Analysis Project (Bonus Points) 
Due Saturday by 11:59pm Points 25 Submitting a file upload Available Oct 29 at 12am - Dec 31 at 11:59pm
Dear students,

 

You may do this optional assignment for bonus points.  The extent we covered on the lecture is sufficient for you to do the assignment. 

This bonus assignment must be done individually and data sets used for the second part (with own dataset) must be your own personal choice. Sharing of a project or data with other students, such as team members is  disallowed for this bonus assignment. Each student must display independence of understanding and analysis and coding.

View and understand the Python programs under Files->Labs->Tutorial_9_AssociationAnalysis. Run this lab on your machine with the provided dataset.

Now, choose a dataset of your own choice with a minimum of 10,000 records and a maximum of 100,000 records and perform association analysis on the dataset.

Test the results with different pairs of minimum support and minimum confidence. (50 points)

Provide an analysis of your results and how they can change for each pair of minimum support and minimum confidence.   (25 points)

Also answer the following two questions: 

(a) If you are a store manager, what actions will you take to decide which set of results above look meaningful? (10 points)

(b) How and What actions will the manager be able to take to improve sales, order inventory and ensure items are accessible easily? (3*5 = 15 points)

Upload your Jupiter Files and screen shots of first few results for every minimum support and minimum confidence pair.  Please provide reasonably extensive comments to indicate your understanding of each step. 

Have fun!

cheers,

:)
